# Resort Booking System - 2022

## Overview

It is an honor for every developer to create a software that can asist users in their daily life. Therefore, I had created a Resort Booking System application websites. This application is used to calculate the discount eligible for the customers and amount payable after being deducted by the discounts.  

There are a lot of programming languages that a developer can use, however, this application is more focuses on **PHP**. Therefore, I had use **PHP**, **HTML**, **CSS** and **Bootstrap**in developing this application.  

First and foremost, I had created `index.php` file, which is the default entry point for any web application. All of Booking instructions had been built in this file. **PHP** had been use to format the webpages as it is a powerful tool for making a dynamic and interactive webpages. 

However, **PHP** is quite limited in designing department. Hence, I had use **CSS** which is the **Cascading Style Sheets** to add specific fonts, colours, and a few elements that can make the website looks more visual dynamic.

Besides, I also use "Bootstrap" in designing the forms and tables. 

There are a few challenges that I entitle during developing this application and the one that I would like to focus is on generating a responsive website by using **Bootstrap**.
